        <p>Music Player App is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of the following:</p>

            <li>Listening habits or preferences</li>
            <li>Any other personal or identifiable information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How the App Works</h2>
        <p>Music Player App operates entirely on your local devices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All music files and app data are stored locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch</li>
            <li><strong>Device-to-Device Transfer:</strong> Music transfers between your iPhone and Watch happen directly over Bluetooth using Apple's WatchConnectivity framework</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud Services:</strong> We do not use any cloud storage or remote servers</li>
            <li><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> We do not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
        <p>The app requests the following iOS permissions to function properly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Access:</strong> To import audio files from your device's Files app</li>
            <li><strong>Media Library:</strong> Optional - to access your music library if you choose to import from it</li>
            <li><strong>Background Audio:</strong> To continue playing music while the app is in the background</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are used only for their stated purposes and do not involve any data collection or transmission.</p>

            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Data is protected by iOS and watchOS security features</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> All data is permanently deleted when you uninstall the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Communication Between Devices</h2>
        <p>Music transfer between your iPhone and Apple Watch uses Apple's WatchConnectivity framework:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer happens directly between your paired devices</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted by the operating system</li>
            <li>No data passes through any external servers</li>
